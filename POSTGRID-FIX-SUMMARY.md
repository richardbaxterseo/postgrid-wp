# PostGrid Block Styling Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The PostGrid block was rendering but without any styling applied. After investigation, I found that:

1. **CSS files were correct** - Both `/src/style.css` and `/build/style-index.css` had proper CSS with correct class selectors
2. **Block registration was correct** - The block was properly registered with a render callback
3. **The problem was a class name mismatch** in the PHP render method

## Root Cause

In `/includes/class-postgrid.php`, the render_block() method was outputting:
```php
$output = '<div class="wp-block-postgrid-postgrid columns-' . esc_attr( $columns ) . '">';
```

But the CSS was expecting:
```css
.wp-block-postgrid {
    display: grid;
    /* ... */
}
```

The extra `-postgrid` suffix in the PHP class name meant the CSS selectors didn't match the HTML output.

## Fix Applied

Changed the render method to use the correct class name:
```php
$output = '<div class="wp-block-postgrid columns-' . esc_attr( $columns ) . '">';
```

## Result

Now the PostGrid block will properly display:
- Grid layout with responsive columns
- Background styling on individual posts
- Proper spacing and typography
- Hover effects
- Column control working (columns-1, columns-2, columns-3, columns-4 classes)

## Testing

Created `test-postgrid-css.html` to demonstrate:
- Before: Block with wrong class (no grid layout)
- After: Block with correct class (proper grid layout)
- Different column variations working correctly

## Note on the Test Page

The page you showed me (https://stg-simracingcockpitgg-srcstage.kinsta.cloud/le-mans-ultimate-how-to-drive-the-lmgt3-and-hypercar/) doesn't actually contain a PostGrid block. The "Related Articles" section appears to be a different implementation, possibly from the theme or another plugin.

To see the PostGrid block in action, you'll need to:
1. Edit a page or post
2. Add the PostGrid block from the block inserter
3. Configure the settings (posts per page, columns, etc.)
4. Save and view the page

The styling should now work correctly with the fixed class name.
